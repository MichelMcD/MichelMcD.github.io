[The Crossover](https://0io.eu/thecrossover/) is a newsletter introducing basic concepts about privacy and security on the internet. It offers advice on digital rights, digital privacy, curates a list of articles, and provides recommendations for simple tools (programs, software, add-ons) that people can use to help them to be safe, secure, and private when online. We also aim to take a moment to explain technology concepts in everyday language, or link to sources that do the same.
