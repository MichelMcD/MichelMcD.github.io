My research focuses on the development of transparent, evidence-based formats for communicating scientific evidence. I design and evaluate visual formats for improving people's comprehension of risks and their associated uncertainties. I led the <a href="https://www.hardingcenter.de/en/research/risk-and-evidence-communication">Risk and Evidence Communication </a> research group at the <a href="https://www.hardingcenter.de/en"> Harding Center for Risk Literacy</a> at the University of Potsdam. Before that, I worked as a research scientist at the Harding Center, in the <i>Centre for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition</i> research group at the <a href="https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en"> Max Planck Institute for Human Development</a> in Berlin. <p>

I have worked with government and non-profit institutions to improve evidence communication, including the <a href="https://www.bfr.bund.de/en/press_information/2017/45/everyday_risks_at_a_glance___promoting_risk_literate_decisions_with_transparent_visualisations-202478.html">German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment </a> and the <i>Bertelsmann Foundation</i> in Germany, and the <i>Cancer Council Queensland</i> in Australia. <p>
